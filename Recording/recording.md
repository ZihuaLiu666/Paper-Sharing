The results of siRNA knockdown are stable now (to 28%). I repeated it for twice with the right primers.

I gonna try it with different RT kit and amplify the reaction volume to 20 uL.

Today I performed qRT-PCR for twice. 

For the first time, I used the original qPCR primers and standarized by GAPDH and ACTB. The results are 

   * no differenced between GAPDH and ACTB; 
  
   * the original qPCR primers: the peaks of negative controls can almost overlap with the experimental group and I suspect the existence of contamination (**Actually, I would like to try the original qPCR primers based on the current RT products tomorrow**).
   
Then, I reverse transcipt total RNA by AG RT kit and qRT-PCR kit. The results are amazing! The melting curve of each samples is pretty clear. Actually, I set four replica and three replica for expr and nc, respectively. No difference in each expr replica. The KD efficiency tendency is similar with the former expr.
